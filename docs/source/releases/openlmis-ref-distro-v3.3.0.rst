3.3.0 Release Notes - 27 April 2018
===================================

Status: Stable
==============

3.3.0 is a stable release, and all users of `OpenLMIS version 3
<https://openlmis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/88670325/3.0.0+Release+-+1+March+2017>`_ are

Release Notes
=============

The OpenLMIS Community is excited to announce the **3.3.0 release** of OpenLMIS! It is another
major milestone in the version 3 `re-architecture <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OP/Re-Architecture>`_
that allows more functionality to be shared among the community of OpenLMIS implementers.

3.3.0 includes a wide range of new features and functionality. The majority of the features were defined as the `Minimal Viable Product (MVP) <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/113144940/Vaccine+MVP>`_, or minimum feature set, to support countries in managing their immunization supply chain by a group of key immunization stakeholders and OpenLMIS community members. Key features include managing cold chain equipment (CCE) inventory, integrating with a Remote Temperature Monitoring (RTM) platform, calculating reorder amounts based on targets, fulfilling orders, and receiving commodities into inventory based on shipments. See the New Features section for details.

For a full list of features and bug-fixes since 3.2.1, see `OpenLMIS 3.3.0 Jira tickets
<https://openlmis.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=status%3DDone%20AND%20project%3DOLMIS%20AND%20fixVersion%3D3.3%20and%20type!%3DTest%20and%20type!%3DEpic%20ORDER%20BY%20%22Epic%20Link%22%20asc%2C%20key%20ASC>`_.

For information about future planned releases, see the `Living Product Roadmap
<https://openlmis.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OP/Living+Product+Roadmap>`_. Pull requests and
`contributions <http://docs.openlmis.org/en/latest/contribute/contributionGuide.html>`_ are welcome.

Compatibility
-------------

The requisition service introduced, `OLMIS-3929 <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/browse/OLMIS-3929>`_: View and edit multiple requisition templates per program, which requires a manual data migration explained `here <https://github.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-requisition-template-migration>`_. 

The fulfillment service has a major release due to the additional features in fulfilling orders within OpenLMIS. Please review the fulfillment service changelog in detail to ensure a clear understanding of the breaking changes.

The reference data service uses new rights associated with the new proof of delivery functionality. Please review the changlog for the Reference data service in detail to ensure a clear understanding of the breaking changes related to rights.

**Batch Requisition Approval**: The Batch Approval screen, which was improved in OpenLMIS 3.2.1,
is still not officially supported. The UI screen is disabled by default. Implementations can
override the code in their local customizations in order to use the screen. Further performance
improvements are needed before the screen is officially supported. See `OLMIS-3182
<https://openlmis.atlassian.net/browse/OLMIS-3182>`_ and the tickets linked to it for details.

New Features
============

OpenLMIS 3.3.0 contains the following features, the majority are specific to the `Vaccine Module MVP  <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/113144940/Vaccine+MVP>`_ Features, were completed by the OpenLMIS development team:

- `Vaccine stock based requisitions <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/browse/OLMIS-4059>`_ that allow users to populate a requisition based on current stock levels and forecasted demand targets or ideal stock amounts.
- `Enhancements to support stock management for vaccines <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/browse/OLMIS-1293>`_.
- `Order fulfillment <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/88670474/Local+Fulfillment>`_, sometimes referred to as the process of resupplying supervised facilities. Includes support for configuring some facilities to have orders fulfilled within OpenLMIS and others sending orders to external suppliers like a National Store or third party supplier. Supports using the ideal product model, ordering using commodity types and fulfilling using TradeItems, to enable end-to-end visibility.
- `Receiving stock <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/88670483/Receiving+stock>`_ into inventory, using an electronic Proof of Delivery based on the shipment details created in OpenLMIS. 
- `Forecasting and Estimation features <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/browse/OLMIS-1294>`_ to upload forecasted demand targets and use those targets to calculate reorder amounts.
- Official release of the Cold Chain Equipment (CCE) service and includes a new feature displaying active alerts on specific pieces of equipment inventory using a standards based interoperability with a Remote Temperature Monitoring (RTM) platform. 
- `Administration screens <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/browse/OLMIS-4067>`_ included assigning requisition templates to facility types within a program, view and create facility types, and manage API keys. 
- The analytics infrastructure and DISC indicators were developed and deployed in a new open-source stack. By the 3.3 release, this technology infrastructure is not deployed within our dockerized microservice architecture. We can provide access to the demo environment for showcasing and will focus on deploying in docker for the next release.

Performance 
========================

OpenLMIS conducted manual performance tests of the same user workflows with the same test data we used in testing v3.2.1 to establish that last-mile performance characteristics have been retained at a minimum. For details on the test results and process, please see `this wiki page <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/116949318/Performance+Metrics>`_ for details. There are minor improvements in the sync, submit, authorize and single approve within the requisition service. For more details about the specific work done to improve performance for 3.3.0, please reference `this <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20OLMIS%20AND%20issuetype%20%3D%20Task%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Done%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%203.3%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20Performance%20AND%20text%20~%20%22performance%22%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20status%20ASC%2C%20key%20ASC>`_ list of tasks.

Test Coverage
=============

OpenLMIS 3.3.0 is the second release using the new `Release Candidate process
<http://docs.openlmis.org/en/latest/conventions/versioningReleasing.html#release-process>`_. As part
of this process, a full manual regression test cycle was conducted, and multiple release candidates
were published to address critical bugs before releasing the final version 3.3.0.

Manual tests were conducted using a set of 136 Zephyr tests tracked in Jira. A total of 50 bugs were
found during testing. The full set of tests were executed on the third Release Candidate (RC3).
With previous release candidates (RC1 and RC2), only the first phase of testing was conducted.
See the spreadsheet of all regression test executions for this release:
`3.3.0-regression-tests.csv <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-ref-distro/master/docs/source/releases/3.3.0-regression-tests.csv>`_.

OpenLMIS 3.3.0 also includes a large set of automated tests. There are multiple types of tests,
including Unit Tests, Integration, Component, Contract and End-to-End. These tests exist in the API
services in Java as well as in the JavaScript UI web application. See the `Testing Guide
<http://docs.openlmis.org/en/latest/conventions/testing.html>`_.

For OpenLMIS 3.3.0, here are a few key statistics on automated tests:

- There are **2,665 unit tests** in the API services in Java, not including other types of tests
  nor tests in the Javascript UI application. `Sonar <http://sonar.openlmis.org/projects>`_ counts
  unit tests on each Java component.
- Test **coverage is over 60%** for all components, both Java and JavaScript, and is over 80% for
  many components. `Sonar <http://sonar.openlmis.org/projects>`_ tracks test coverage and fails
   quality gates if developers contribute new code with less than 80% coverage.

All of the automated tests, both Java and Javascript tests of all types, are passing as of the time
of the release. Any failing test would stop the build and block a release.

Further advances in automated testing are still on the horizon for future releases of OpenLMIS:

- Automated performance tests: There is already an automated test tool that measures the speed of
  API endpoints with a large set of performance test data. However, not all tests pass and there is
  not an established baseline for performance/speed of all areas of the system. Achieving this will
  greatly improve the objective means for tracking and improving performance.
- End-to-end testing: There is already an end-to-end testing toolset. However, coverage is very low.
  The addition of more end-to-end automated tests can reduce the manual test effort that is
  currently required for each release. It can help developers identify and fix regressions so the
  community can move towards a “continuous delivery” release process.

All Changes by Component
========================

Version 3.3.0 of the Reference Distribution contains updated versions of the components listed
below. The Reference Distribution bundles these component together using Docker to create a complete
OpenLMIS instance. Each component has its own own public GitHub repository (source code) and
DockerHub repository (release image). The Reference Distribution and components are versioned
independently; for details see `Versioning and Releasing
